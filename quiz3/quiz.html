<strong>How Digitally Rhetorical Are You?</strong><br><br>
<form METHOD="POST">
<strong>Invention</strong><br>
You tell students "to begin your next paper, start with one of your classmates previous papers. 
Pick one that you know was successful or highly graded if you can. Copy and paste all of the 
text into a new file and begin systematically editing the file at the word and sentence level 
to allow it to suit your current topic and context more readily."<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="a" VALUE="1">Been there, done that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="a" VALUE="2">I might give this a shot as an in-class exercise.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="a" VALUE="3">Um, I don't know about that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="a" VALUE="4">That's cheating! (but do you have an old committee report I could look at, I have one due next week...)<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="a" VALUE="5">That's it! I am not reading any further!.<br><br>

<strong>Arrangement</strong></br>
You say "I don't want you to think of 'paragraphs' as the important chunks in this writing assignment.
Each chunk - whatever its size - should have the same overall structure and should stand alone. 
If a reader encounters it, they should be able to understand it in isolation from the other chunks. 
No transitional statements or indexicals allowed!"<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="b" VALUE="1">Been there, done that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="b" VALUE="2">I might give this a shot as an in-class exercise.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="b" VALUE="3">Um, I don't know about that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="b" VALUE="4">That's cheating!<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="b" VALUE="5">That's it! I am not reading any further!.<br><br>

<strong>Style</strong></br>
You explain "we are going to think of style information as metadata, a layer of information that 
helps to describe how our message should look on the page, who its should address itself to, 
and how these factors should influence the way audience members, overall, experience that message. 
I want you to compose two distinct metadata layers for your message, encoding them in a 
formalized way using Cascading Style Sheets, in order to customize your message for 
two different audiences."<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="c" VALUE="1">Been there, done that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="c" VALUE="2">I might give this a shot as an in-class exercise.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="c" VALUE="3">Um, I have no idea what you're talking about.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="c" VALUE="4">That technobabble doesn't belong in my classroom!<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="c" VALUE="5">That's it! I am not reading any further!.<br><br>

<strong>Memory</strong></br>
You say "when you turn in your assignment, please make sure that I have read/write/execute access 
to your public web directory so that I can access the change histories of your drafts."
<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="d" VALUE="1">Been there, done that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="d" VALUE="2">I might give this a shot as an in-class exercise.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="d" VALUE="3">Um, is this a portfolio we are talking about? 'cause I have some manilla folders on hand...<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="d" VALUE="4">I teach writing, not computer science!<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="d" VALUE="5">That's it! I am not reading any further!.<br><br>

<strong>Delivery</strong></br>
You implore: "No print please! I can't evaluate the transformations you've designed 
if I only have static views on paper!"<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="e" VALUE="1">Been there, done that.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="e" VALUE="2">I might give this a shot as an in-class exercise.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="e" VALUE="3">Um, I think I might need to upgrade my browser.<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="e" VALUE="4">You mean I have to sit in front of a computer all day to grade these things?<br>
<input TYPE="radio" NAME="e" VALUE="5">That's it! I am not reading any further!.<br><br>
